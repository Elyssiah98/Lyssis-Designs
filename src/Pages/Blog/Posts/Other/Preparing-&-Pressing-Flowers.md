Pressing flowers is a simple and beautiful way to preserve flowers for art, scrapbooking, or decoration. I used an old Avon flower press kit over the years to experiment with different types of flowers and leaves. The process takes a bit of time, but the results a lovely and delicate.

## Tools & Materials :
- Avon flower press kit
    - wooden boards
    - Cardboard layers
    - Blotting paper
    - Wing nuts and screws
- Fresh flowers or leaves

### Optional :
- Notebook (to track what was pressed)
- Scissors (for trimming stems)

## Process :

I started by selecting a few fresh flowers and leaves. I looked for pieces that weren't too thick, as well key flowers like roses do not press as well, and less separated into petals. Flat faced flowers tend to give me the better results.

Using the Avon flower press, I unscrewed the wing nuts and open it up. I placed a layer of cardboard on to the base wood and then a layer of blotting paper. I then place my chosen flowers gently onto the blotting paper, adjusting petals and leaves so that they lay flat. I then place another piece of blood paper on top and then the cardboard. This process can be repeated for multiple layers. After the last piece of cardboard, I place the other piece of wood on top, to go over the screws. Attachment the wing nuts evenly on all four corners to apply consistent pressure.

The press is left in a dry space for about two weeks. About once a day I will gently tighten the wing nuts. This gives the flowers enough time to fully dry and flatten when I opened it up again the colours are muted, but the details are preserved beautifully.
