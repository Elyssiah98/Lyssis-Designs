This project brought together my love for mythical creatures with my recent journey into printmaking. I chose to design a Kirin, which is a Japanese mythological creature often described as a cross between a dragon and a deer. I then transformed it into a block print. The process allowed me to apply digital design skills alongside hands on carving and inking techniques.

### Printing Lino :
- Block printing ink (various colours)
- Palette knife
- Roller
- Glass or acrylic inking plate
- Roller printer
- Paper to be printed onto
- Cleaning cloths
- Paper towels
- Drying rack
- Water
- Soap

### Optional :

I began by sketching my Kirin design digitally using my iPad and the program Affinity Photo 2. I set up a 10x15cm templates on the canvas to match the exact dimensions of my lino block. This ensured that every detail I drew would transfer at the correct scale in the carbon tracing stage.

To add extra interest, and to give the design a more ethereal feeling, I incorporated cherry blossoms around the Kirin. The petals helped frame the creature and brought in a sense of movement. I deliberately placed the blossoms so that some were falling around the Kirin to help balance out the blank spaces in the canvas.

Once I was happy with the design, I printed it onto plain paper. This allowed me to check the proportions and line thickness at full size before committing to the lino transfer.

I then transferred the design onto the lino using carbon paper, taping both the design and the carbon paper in place so that they wouldnâ€™t shift. I traced over all the lines with a pen, making sure to apply enough pressure for a clean transfer.

Carving the Kirin was a quick process for me. See [Carving Lino](#/blog/Printmaking/Printmaking-Techniques/Carving-Lino). I started by outlining all the major shapes with shallow cuts, then deepened the lines. Once the lines had been carved away, I removed the background to help the Kirin and blossoms stand out.

When the carving was complete, I inked the block and ran it through the roller printer. You can read more about this process in my [Printing on Lino Using Rollers](#/blog/Printmaking/Printmaking-Techniques/Printing-on-Lino-Using-Rollers) post.

To explore how background colours could affect the mood of the piece, I intentionally avoided using white paper. My first print was blue ink on beige card. Next, I tried yellow ink on brown card, but this combination made the design a bit difficult to see. I then switched to blue ink on a deep pink card. This contrast worked beautifully and quickly became one of my favourite combinations.

I also experimented with layered, two-coloured prints. For one, I printed yellow onto pink card, then added a layer of blue ink over the top. The two layers were slightly misaligned by accident, but I embraced the offset; it gave the print a sense of motion and energy. In another version, I reused the leftover blue ink by printing it onto beige card, which resulted in a faded, ghostly image. I added green over the top, also offset, which created an ethereal, almost dreamlike final result.
