For this drypoint print, we were encouraged to continue exploring interesting creatures. I decided to base my design on the kitsune, a mythical Japanese fox spirit known for its multiple tails and magical abilities. This was a great opportunity to develop storytelling within my work.

## Tools & Materials :
-	UHT milk carton (clean and opened out flat)
-	Carbon paper
-	Pencil
-	Etching needle
-	Tracing wheel
-	Wire brush
-	Printing ink
-	Cardboard scrap (for inking)
-	Scrim (similar to cheesecloth)
-	Lightweight paper (e.g., old phone book pages or tissue paper)
-	Printing paper
-	Water
-	Container (big enough to hold printing paper in the water)
-	Towels
-	Rollers
-	Press blankets (felt blankets)

### Optional:
-	Scalpel
-	Apron

## Process :

I started by sketching the kitsune design, looking at fox references to help me draw a dynamic, running pose. To clearly identify the creature as a kitsune, I added seven flowing tails. The sketch was transferred onto the inside of a UHT milk carton using carbon paper, being careful not to press too hard and dent the surface.

For a full breakdown of how to prepare, ink, and print from a Tetra-Pak, see [Tetra-Pak Drypoint](#/blog/Printmaking/Printmaking-Techniques/Tetra-Pak-Drypoint).

Once the main form was complete, I began building the background. I added Japanese inspired cloud motifs to frame the kitsune, helping to create a stylised setting. Around the folks, I drew several Japanese flame designs to add visual interest to the piece.

To make some of the flames stand out more, I lightly cut away and peeled back small areas from the top layer of the Tetra-Pak foil around them. This allows for greater contrast in the final print, helping those elements really stand out from the surface.

This was an enjoyable project, allowing me to experiment with movement, layered design, and symbolism. Combining detailed line work with stylized shapes helped to bring the kitsune to life. I'm excited to try and explore printmaking more in the future.
