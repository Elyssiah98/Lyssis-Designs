This project focused on refreshing and building upon my previous experience with lino carving, which I had done back in high school. It had been a long time since I’d worked with lino., so I used this session to refamiliarize myself with the tools and techniques. While it started off a bit challenging, I quickly got back into it; learning how to handle the tools with more control, and how the condition of the lino affects the final carving results.

## Tools & Materials :
- Lino sheet
- Ruler
- Pen or pencil
- Stanley knife
- Lino carving tools (both basic and higher quality)

### Optional :
- Portable electric stove
- Non-slip mat
- Paintbrush
- Printing ink

## Process :
Before I could begin carving, I needed to cut my lino sheet down to the required size of 10x15cm. I used a ruler and pen to mark out the shape, then lined the ruler up with the markings. Using a Stanley knife, I made light, shallow passes along the ruler to score the lino.

I also cut a smaller test piece, which was what I used for the rest of this post.

After cutting most of the way through, I gently bent the lino along the scored line, balanced the lino upright, then used the knife again to complete the cut. This technique gave me clean, precise edges, without cracking or tearing the lino.

To better see the lines I was carving, I brushed a thin layer of block printing ink over the surface and let it dry. This helped visualised the test designs and made the cuts much more visible during practice.

I initially found the lino too cold and hard to carve smoothly… most likely because it had been in my bag next to my lunchbox, which had an icepack inside. The cold lino made carving difficult, with messier results. To solve this, I used a portable electric stove to gently warm the lino for about a minute.

I drew some simple varying lines to practice with the lino tools; I thought it best to first test out the accuracy and trouble-shoot before carving out my final design.

I tested both cheap and high-quality carving tools on the lino. The cheaper tools were inconsistent, with duller blades that created rough, untidy lines. This made clean cuts in the lino difficult to achieve.

When I switched to better quality carving tools, the experience was completely different. The sharp blades allowed for much cleaner and more accurate cuts. It made the process much more enjoyable and efficient.

Once I felt comfortable using the lino tools, I was ready to start working on my [Kirin Design](#/blog/Printmaking/Completed-Pieces/Lino-Kirin). Also see [Printing on Lino](#/blog/Printmaking/Printmaking-Techniques/Printing-on-Lino-Using-Rollers), to see how to ink up a lino cut design.
