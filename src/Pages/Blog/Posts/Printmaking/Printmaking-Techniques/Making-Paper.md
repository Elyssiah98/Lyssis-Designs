This project gave me the chance to explore traditional paper-making techniques using recycled materials. The outcome was a coloured, texture stack of handmade paper sheets that could be used later on in printmaking. See [Printing on Lino] to learn more.

## Tools & Materials :
-	Scrap paper
-	Coloured scrap paper
-	Large container
-	Blender
-	Water
-	Box (for torn up paper)
-	Paper making frame
-	Towel
-	Cotton cloths

## Process :

I began by tearing up old paper into smaller pieces and placing them into a box. The coloured paper is kept separate, so that it can be added later. Tearing everything into smaller pieces makes it easier to blend smoothly.

Next, a handful of torn paper (not the coloured paper) was placed into a blender and a generous amount of water was added. The mixture is blended until it reaches a smooth, pulpy consistency. The water helps break down the paper fibres and helps to achieve an even texture.

Once blended, the pulp mixture is poured into a large container and left to sit for a while to allow the paper to breakdown more. Ideally, multiple amounts from the blender are poured in. This container will become the dipping bath for forming each new sheet of paper.

Before dipping the frame, the mixture is gently stirred to keep the pulp evenly distributed, then the torn pieces of coloured paper are sprinkled in. The torn coloured paper is not blended, as it would turn the whole mix grey. By keeping the coloured scraps whole, a more interesting, speckled effect in the final paper could be achieved.

To form a sheet, the paper-making frame is dipped into the container and lifted slowly, allowing just enough pulp to cover the mesh of the frame. It is important not to overload it, as it can make the sheet of paper too thicken, uneven and takes a long time to dry. Excess water is drained out as much as possible; lifting the frame slightly can help drain even more out.

With the pulp still damp, the frame is carefully flipped upside-down onto a cotton cloth that has been placed on top of a towel. Using the plastic square that comes with the frames, gently push down to help it transfer to the cloth. This can also help squeeze out some of the excess water. To release the paper, gently shake one corner to help it peel away. Slowly shake until the entire piece of paper is off of the frame and on the cotton cloth. The towel underneath can help absorb some of the additional water from the sheet of paper.

The paper is left to dry. Sometimes, placing another cotton cloth on top can help draw out the remaining water. This also makes it possible to stack multiple sheets by alternating cloth and wet paper is layers. This will also inadvertently save space while the sheets of paper are drying.

> ### Notes:
> For some types of paper, especially those made of fibres that don’t naturally bond well, a substance called sizing can be added to the pulp. This helps the fibres join together and improves the paper’s structure. In this project, sizing did not need to be added because most of the scraps used were from printmaking paper, which already contains sizing.
