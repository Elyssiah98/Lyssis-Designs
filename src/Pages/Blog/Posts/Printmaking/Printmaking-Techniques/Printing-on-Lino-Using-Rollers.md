After [Carving my Lino](#/blog/Printmaking/Printmaking-Techniques/Carving-Lino) block, I moved on to the printing process using roller printers. The focus was on learning how to ink the lino evenly and transfer the image cleanly onto paper. Although the concept is straight forward, the technique can make a big difference in the final outcome.

## Tools & Materials :
- Carved lino block
- Block printing ink (various colours)
- Palette knife
- Roller
- Glass or acrylic inking plate
- Roller printer
- Paper to be printed onto
- Cleaning cloths
- Paper towels
- Drying rack
- Water
- Soap

## Process :

I began by preparing my workspace and using a palette knife to grab a small amount of block printing ink onto a glass inking plate. I used the palette knife to create a few spread lines.
Using the roller, I rolled the ink up and down, then left to right, until it formed an even, slightly tacky layer on the roller and a nice ink square on the inking plate. Itâ€™s important not to overload the roller, as too much ink can flood the carved lines and blur the print, and too little may not sufficiently cover the lino print design.

Once the roller was evenly coated, I rolled it across the surface of my carved lino block. I made sure to apply pressure consistently and check that the ink reached all areas of the raised design. I did this in both directions. Getting an even coat can take a bit of practice, especially if the carving has fine lines or varying depths.

After inking the block, I carefully placed the lino centered on the template by the printing rollers. Next, I laid a clean sheet of paper on top of the lino, making sure it was properly aligned, with extra space at the bottom. To protect the roller and prevent any ink from transferring onto it (which could affect other prints), I placed a protective sheet of paper over the printing paper.

With everything positioned, I slowly rolled the wheel on the roller printer, passing the paper and lino block through the press evenly. Once through, I carefully removed the protective paper first, followed by the printed paper. I place the freshly printed sheet onto a drying rack to dry flat.

Cleaning the lino block after printing is important to maintain its quality, and to prevent unwanted colours transferring onto future prints. Rather than running it under water, I dampened a cloth with water and applied a little soap. Using the soapy cloth, I gently wiped the lino surface, removing any residual ink. This method helps avoid damaging the lino or pushing excess water into the carved grooves.

To further clean out the ink trapped in the carved areas, I folded a piece of paper towel several times and placed it on top of the lino block before running it once more through the printer without adding any new ink. This blotting pass helps absorb excess ink from the recessed parts, ensuring sharper prints next time.
