An emery stick is a tool used in silversmithing for smoothing and finishing metal edges. Having the emery paper wrapped around a wooden stick allows for better pressure and control when finishing pieces, as opposed to the loose sheets on their own.

## Tools & Materials :

- Wooden Stick
- Emery paper
    - 400 grit
    - 800 grit
    - 1200 grit
    - 2500 grit
- Scissors
- Tape
- Ruler
- Pen/Pencil

## Process :

Mark and cut the emery paper into strips that are slightly smaller than the wooden stick and long enough to wrap around it and over itself for an extra length. Attach one side of the emery paper to the stick using tape. Wrap the rest of the paper tightly around the stick and tape down the ends at the top and bottom to hold it in place. Clearly label the emery stick at the top with the grit number.

> ### Notes :
> I recently came across someone using paper tacks, instead of glue or tape. I think this is a smart idea and will try the next time I create an emery stick.
