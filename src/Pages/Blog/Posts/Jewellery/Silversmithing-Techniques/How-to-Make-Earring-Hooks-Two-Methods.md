Earring hooks are made separately from the earring itself. There are many methods, but her are the two methods I have learnt using wire.
## Tools & Materials :
- Practice wire (I used copper wire)
- Jewellery pliers
    - Round-nose pliers
    - Chain-nose pliers
- Wire cutters
- Ruler
- Emery stick

### Optional :
- Small round cylindrical shape (like knitting needles) [method 1]
- Hook jig [method 2]

## Process :
### Method 1 – By Hand :
Start by cutting 1 piece of wire, between 10cm and 20cm in length. Fold the wire in half.

Using round nose pliers, grip the wires at the fold and wrap it around. Take note of the placement on the round nose pliers as they taper, which can change the final size of this loop. Bend the loop back slightly so that it is centred, and not to the side, of the tail.

At the height you want the earring loop to be, bend the wire gently around your cylindrical item. The join of the initial loop should be on the inner side.

Saw between the wires at the fold. Use an emery stick to tidy up the tails. Bend the tail of the wire. 

Use the chain-nose pliers to open the loop and close it back up. To open and close the loop, the pliers should twist the wires open.

### Method 2 – With a Jig :
Start by cutting 2 pieces of wire, between 5cm and 10cm in length. Ensure they are both the same length.

Using round nose pliers, grip the wires at the fold and wrap it around. Take note of the placement on the round nose pliers as they taper, which can change the final size of this loop. Bend the loop back slightly so that it is centred, and not to the side, of the tail.

Place the loop onto the jig starting point and follow the guides to create the earring hooks.

Cut both sides to the same length and use an emery stick to tidy up the tails.

Use the chain-nose pliers to open the loop and close it back up. To open and close the loop, the pliers should twist the wires open.
