Roller printing is a technique used to create a debossed (indented) design on metals surfaces in jewellery making.

## Tools & Materials : 
- Rolling Mill
- Metal for debossing (e.g., aluminium, copper, silver)
- A die

### Optional :
- Glue

## Process :
A die is a tool used to cut or mould metal into a specific shape. Dies can be made from various materials, including card, wire or textiles such as lace and ribbon. It is important to note that the die will typically be destroyed during the roller printing process. A die can also be used on both sides of the metal sheet; however, this may result in unwanted embossing on the reverse side. A die can be created; an example would be cutting out a design on card.

Once both the metal and die have been prepared, the die can either be glued in place or positioned directly before going through the rollers. If glue is used, it must be completely dry before printing, as wet glue may damage or corrode the rollers.

Before printing, ensure the rollers are clean. The height between the rollers can be adjusted using the top lever. Adjust it so that it is slightly smaller than the thickness of the metal. To check, the metal can be placed at the roller entrance for testing. The side lever is then rotated to feed the metal and die through the rollers. The printed design will come out the other side.

Some experimentation may be required to achieve a successful print. Printing on the same metal a second time is not advised, as it can distort and further flatten. A new metal sheet should be used instead for each attempt.

As the printing process causes the metal to expand, it is best not to pre-cut the metal unless a particular shape is a stylistic choice.

After printing the metal, it most likely curved. Use a rawhide mallet on a flat surface such as an anvil, to flatten the embossed metal.
