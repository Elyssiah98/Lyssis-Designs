This was my first time using a disc cutter to create clean, round metal shapes for jewellery making. It's a simple but effective tool that allows you to punch out consistent circles from metal sheet. The technique is useful for creating various components such as earrings, pendants, charms and the like. See [Star and Moon Earrings](#/blog/Jewellery/Completed-Jewellery/Star-and-Moon-Earrings), as an example.

## Tools & Materials :
-	Soft metal sheet (e.g. copper, aluminium, silver)
-	Disc cutter block
-	Rawhide mallet
-	Bench block or sturdy work surface

## Process :

A quick disclaimer, this process was done by my instructor, because if done incorrectly, it is very expensive to replace the disc cutters.

To begin, I selected a disc size and placed my metal sheet over the corresponding hole on the cutting block. I made sure the metal was aligned so that the shape would be centered where I wanted it.

Next, I inserted the matching punch into the hole, resting it lightly on top of the metal. Holding everything steadily, the punch was firmly struck with a rawhide mallet. This cut the metal cleanly, leaving behind a round disc.

> ### Notes
> - The disc cutter only works well on soft sheet metal; hard or thick metal can damage the tool or result in a poor cut.
> - Always work on a solid surface, like a bench block, to ensure a clean punch.
