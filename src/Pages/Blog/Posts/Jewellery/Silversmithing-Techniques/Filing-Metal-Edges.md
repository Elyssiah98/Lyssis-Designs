After sawing out a design on metal sheet, the edges are left rough, sharp and in need of refinement. Filing and sanding is need for smoot, tidy edges.

## Tools & Materials :

- Piece to be refined
- Needle files
    - Flat
    - Half-round
    - Round
- Emery paper
    -	400 grit
    -	800 grit
    -	1200 grit
    -	2500 grit

## Process :

### Filing :

First, start with the needle files to remove the bulk of the roughness. The type of file chosen depends on the shape of the edge:

-	Flat files are best for straight edges.
-	Half-round files are best for gentle curves and corners.
-	Round files are best for circular and inner shapes.

There are many other file shapes available, dependent on the situation, but these three are the most used for basic jewellery work.

File in one direction, applying pressure on the forward stroke. Filing back and forth can clog or damage the needle files. Position your piece securely on a bench pin to help manoeuvre the metal while filing. Once smooth, move on to the emery sticks.

### Sanding :
Emery paper is graded by grit, the higher the number, the finer the grit.

Start with the 400-grit emery paper. Wrap it around a wooden stick to make a custom emery stick. Sand in a direction perpendicular to your filing marks. This helps remove them more efficiently. Move on to the 800-grit, then the 1200-grit and finally the 2500-grit, sanding in alternate directions each time.

See [Making an Emery Stick](#/blog/Jewellery/Silversmithing-Techniques/Making-an-Emery-Stick) for how to prepare them.
