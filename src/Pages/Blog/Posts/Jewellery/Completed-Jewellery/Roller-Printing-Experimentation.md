In this post, I will be sharing my explorations using the rolling mill. This post will be just the experimentation, if you would like to see how to use a rolling mill, please see [Roller Printing](#/blog/Jewellery/Silversmithing-Techniques/Roller-Printing).

## Tools & Materials :
- Rolling Mill
- Metal for debossing (e.g., aluminium, copper, silver)
- Various dies:
    - Vinyl cut into a star shape
    - Textured ribbon
    - Textured fabric
    - Textured card
    - Lace
    - Paper cut into a design (bear)
    - String

### Optional :
- Glue
- Everyday scissors
- Fabric scissors.
- Pencil

## Process :
### Vinyl Cut into a Star Shape

</figure>

For this first experimentation, I drew a star design using a pencil and then cut out the vinyl. This was very tedious and not the cleanest design. This was also the basis of the [Star and Moon Earrings](#/blog/Jewellery/Completed-Jewellery/Star-and-Moon-Earrings).
</div>

</figure>

The vinyl moved in unexpected ways, causing the star design to be further deteriorated. However, it still resembled a star, so I deemed it to be a success, with hypothesis testing required to fully understand the results achieved.

### Lace

<div class="clearfix">

    <img src="/Lyssis-Designs/Images/Jewellery/RolllerPrintingLace.jpg">
    <figcaption>Left: Lace used as die. Middle: Result of lace on aluminium. Right: Lace unused as die.</figcaption>
</figure>

For this experiment, I cut out a piece of lace with fabric scissors. I purposely had the lace bigger than the metal sample, as I wanted to see the design go all the way to the edge. I deem this experiment successful, and the design came out as predicted.
If I were to further explore this technique, I would change the lace proportion when compared to the metal. I would try having the lace smaller than the metal, lace on both sides of the metal, and multiple layers of the lace positioned in different orientations.

### Textured Card

<div class="clearfix">
<figure class="flex-left" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="/Lyssis-Designs/Images/Jewellery/RollerPrintingTexturedCard.jpg">
  <figcaption>Left: Textured card unused as die. Middle: Result of textured card on aluminium. Right: Textured card used as die.</figcaption>
</figure>

For this attempt, I used everyday scissors to cut out part of a design in textured card. I glued this down onto the metal before taking it through the rolling mill. I am happy with the result.
</div>

### Textured Ribbon

<div class="clearfix">
<figure class="flex-right" style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: 1rem;">

    <figcaption>Left: Textured ribbon used as die. Middle: Result of textured ribbon on aluminium. Right: Textured ribbon unused as die.</figcaption>
</figure>

For this experiment, I glued down 2 pieces of textured ribbon onto the metal. I really liked the results and decided to base my [Butterfly Earrings](#/blog/Jewellery/Completed-Jewellery/Butterfly-Earrings) on this. I would have liked to have further explored the layout of the ribbon if time was given, in a similar approach to the lace die above.

### Paper Cut into a Design (Bear)

<div class="clearfix">
<figure class="flex-left" style="width: 12rem;">
  <img src="/Lyssis-Designs/Images/Jewellery/RolllerPrintingPaperDesign.jpg">
  <figcaption>Left: Bear Paper die after use. Right: Result of paper design on aluminium.</figcaption>
</figure>

For this design, the bear had already been cut out, and I glued it onto the metal. For a simple design, I was happy to see how much detail came through once it went through the rolling mill.
</div>

### String
<div class="clearfix">

  <img src="/Lyssis-Designs/Images/Jewellery/WrappedStringExperimentation.jpg">
  <figcaption>Aluminium wrapped with string.</figcaption>
</figure>

For the final experimentation using the rolling mill, I wanted to test seeing a different design coming through on both sides. I wrapped a piece of string around the metal, to then go through the rolling mill. The results were successful, but it is not my preference in design.
