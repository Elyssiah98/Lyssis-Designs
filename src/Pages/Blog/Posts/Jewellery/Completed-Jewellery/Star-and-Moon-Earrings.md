These earrings started while I was [experimenting with the rolling mill](#/Blog/Jewellery/Completed-Jewellery/Roller-Printing-Experimentation). I tried to use star shapes hand cut from vinyl and printed them onto aluminium. The prints looked promising, so I planned to develop the idea further.</div>

## Tools :
- Rolling mill
- Jeweller’s saw and blades
- Needle files
- Drill + drill bits (1mm)
- Emery sticks (varying grits)
- Round-nose pliers
- Chain-nose pliers
- Glue stick
- Sharpie
- Cricut machine
- Digital drawing tools (for making SVG's)
- Disk cutter

## Materials :
- Aluminium sheet (1mm)
- Textured card (for roller printing)
- Silver wire

## Process:

The vinyl was tricky to work with. It was fiddly to cut out and the designs would shift and stretch when they were rolled, which made the final prints inconsistent.

At home, I came up with different designs based on the stars and moon. I wanted to keep the roller printed stars in my design, but needed a consistent way to get clean, consistent shapes.

Looking back over my previous roller printing experiments, I realised that the textured card held up much better than the vinyl. I create a new star design as a scalable vector graphic (SVG) using my iPad.

I then cut out the SVG stars using my Cricut machine in several sizes, so that I had options to choose from. This gave me much more accurate results and cleaner shapes than hand-cut vinyl.

Next, I glued the stars to onto the aluminium and ran the metal through the rolling mill again. See [Roller Printing](#/blog/Jewellery/Silversmithing-Techniques/Roller-Printing) for how to use a rolling mill. I had to repeat this a few times as the pressure wasn’t quite right at first, but eventually I had nice, clear prints.
</div>

Originally, I wanted to cut the printed pieces into circles with a disk cutter. [See Using a Disk Cutter](#/blog/Jewellery/Silversmithing-Techniques/Using-a-Disk-Cutter). Unfortunately, TAFE did not have the size I required, so I adapted the design by leaving flat edges at the top and bottom, which could still be adapted into a moon shape.

Once shaped, I used needle files and emery sticks to smooth the edges. See how in [Filing Metal Edges](#/blog/Jewellery/Silversmithing-Techniques/Filing-Metal-Edges). I drilled a hole at the top of each piece for the hooks.

I then made the hooks for the earrings. See how I did this in [How to Make Earring Hooks (Two Methods)](#/blog/Jewellery/Silversmithing-Techniques/How-to-Make-Earring-Hooks-Two-Methods). My original plan was to cut a quarter moon and a star from the middle of each earring, but I ran out of time. That’s something I still plan to try and finish in the future.
