Sawing is one of the most common ways to cut out shapes from sheet metal in jewellery making. It allows for precision, especially when working with detailed or delicate designs.

## Tools & Materials:

- Jeweller’s saw frame
- Saw blades (various sizes depending on metal thickness)
- Wooden bench pin
- Metal sheet (e.g., aluminium, copper, silver)
- Safety glasses

### Optional:
- Design template
- Glue (to secure template)

## Process:
Before starting, ensure the design is clearly marked on the metal. This can be done in many ways; by gently etching or drawing on it, or by gluing a paper template.

To load the saw blade, first loosen the top wingnut of the jeweller’s saw frame. The blade must be inserted in the correct orientation; the teeth should point downwards and away from the frame. Place the blade into the top clamp and tighten the wingnut. Use the wingnut on the frame to adjust the height of the saw. Press the frame against a bench to slightly compress it. Insert the other end of the blade into the bottom clamp and tighten the corresponding wingnut. A properly tightened blade will produce a high-pitched ping sound when gently flicked with a fingernail. If the sound is dull, it may need to be tightened further. Be careful as overtightening can cause the blade to snap.

Sawing is done in always done vertically, using a downward motion. This allows the blade to do the work. Do not force the saw forward, instead apply gentle, even pressure.

To begin sawing, use a light up and down motion to create a notch for the blade to sit in.

When navigating corners and curves, reduce the forwards motion and continue sawing in place, while rotating the metal slowly.

To do inner cut-outs or designs, drill a small hole inside the section to be removed. Unclamp the top end of the blade, and thread it through the hole. Re-tighten the blade and saw as you would have on the perimeter of the design.

## Tips and Safety for Sawing:
- A V-shaped notch in the bench pin is helpful for supporting smaller pieces and allowing room for the blade to move.
- The non-dominant hand should be holding the metal in place. Always keep the fingers behind the blade and out of its path.
- Safety glasses and enclosed shoes should be worn in case of a blade snapping or shrapnel coming off the metal.
- Long hair should be tied back.
