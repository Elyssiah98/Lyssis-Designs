A darkroom photo enlarger is a machine that allows you to develop photos on light sensitive paper from negatives. In this post I will walk you through setting up and using a darkroom photo enlarger.

## Tools & Materials :

- Darkroom photo enlarger
- Film carrier
- Easel for holding paper
- Light-sensitive photographic paper
- Contrast filters
- Block-out room / block-out materials / block-out curtains
- Safelight
- Notebook (for recording settings)
- Negatives
</div>

## Process :
In this tutorial, I will use the proper terminology for the darkroom photo enlarger. If you are unsure as to what I am referring to, please refer to the diagram. Throughout the setup, ensure that all light-sensitive paper is not in any light until taking the actual photo. At TAFE SA, there is a separate draw by each machine that will not let any light through. It is also advised that any electronic devices stay out of the room. Ensure the room is fully light proof with block-out doors, curtains, materials, etc.

### Safelights and Timers :
Turn on the overhead safelights (red lights), as these need to be on to see, and will not expose the light-sensitive (unless left for many, many hours). Test the exposure timer at 3 seconds (this time can vary as needed). Count to ensure the timer is at three seconds, as this overtime can become inaccurate. For the timer that we had available, there was a knob and 3 buttons. The knob is used to adjust the amount of time that the light on the photo enlarger is on. The three buttons each have a coloured dot. From left to right: red, white and green. Pressing the green button turns on the machine light for the duration of the timer. Pressing the green and white light together turns on the machine light indefinitely. Pressing the red button turns off the light and resets the timer.

See the three photos below for examples:

### The Elevation Knob :

Use the elevation knob to adjust the height of the machine. The higher the enlarger head, the larger the projection, but also the dimmer and less sharp the final image can become. In my experimentations, I always had it at 40cm.

### Optional - Adding Filters :

- Filters can be used to adjust the sharpness and tone. They typically come in a packet number 00 (low contrast) to 5 (high contrast). These filters slide under the light source and above the film carrier. Ensure the machine light is off before sliding the filter in.

### Focusing the Image :
Turn off the main lights (not the safelights). To focus the image, start by placing the negative onto the film carrier and turning on the machine. Adjust the focus knob the see a clear image projected onto the easel. If you are instead using another technique such as OHP paper or objects, this step is not required.

### Setting the Aperture :

Set the aperture lens to fully open (brightest setting). Now adjust the aperture to the right by 4 clicks (which can be felt when gently adjusting the aperture lens).

A printable checklist of the above is also available.

> ### Notes :
> - It is best practice to always do an exposure test before taking the final photo. See [How to Make a Test Exposure Strip](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Make-a-Test-Exposure-Strip).
> - Exposure, contrast filters, aperture and height all interact and change each otherâ€™s settings. Only change one of these variables at a time.
> - Document settings of the machine setup in case the same image with these settings needs to be used.
