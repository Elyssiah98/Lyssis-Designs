A test exposure strip is an essential first step when developing photographs using traditional methods. In this post, I’ll explain how I learnt to create one.

## Tools & Materials :
### For Exposure :
- Darkroom photo enlarger
- Easel
- Light-sensitive photographic paper
- Block-out room / block-out materials / block-out curtains
- Safelight
- Notebook

### For Development :
- 4 trays
- 4 tongs
- Developer solution (Ilford Multigrade Developer)
- Stop bath solution (Ilford Ilfostop)
- Fixer solution (Ilford Hypam Fixer)
- Running water
- A clock or timer
- Pegs
- Line to hold pegs

## Process :
Start by [Setting Up the Darkroom Enlarger](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Set-Up-a-Darkroom-Photo-Enlarger-Machine) and placing a small strip of light-sensitive photographic paper on the easel. Use the easel’s ruler to divide the paper into roughly ten equal sections. Hold the notebook slightly above the paper to cover nine-tenths of the strip. Turn on the enlarger for 3 seconds, then shift the notebook down by one section and repeat the exposure. Complete until only one segment remains completely unexposed. [Develop the strip](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/Developing-Photos) and hang it to dry.

My first test exposure strip was unsuccessful because I didn’t fully submerge the paper in the developing solution, which resulted in a large, uneven white area. However, this mistake helped me to improve my technique in future explorations.

My next test strip was successful, and I continued to produce effective exposure strips throughout the following weeks. See any further test strips I did in the following weeks were also successful. See [Ho-Oh Photography](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photos/Ho-Oh-Photography) & [Pressed Flower Negatives](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photos/Ho-Oh-Photography) posts for examples of the test exposure strips used on those days.
