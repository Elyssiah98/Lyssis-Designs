Once the photo paper has been exposed; it needs to go through various chemicals to fully develop into the final picture. Here is the step-by-step process.

## Tools & Materials :

- Photo to be developed
- 4 Trays
- 4 Tongs
- Developer solution (Ilford Multigrade Developer)
- Stop bath solution (Ilford Ilfostop)
- Fixer solution (Ilford Hypam Fixer)
- Running water
- A clock or timer
- Pegs
- Line to hold pegs

## Process :

This process is done in the darkroom under the safe lights. See [Darkroom Machine Setup](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Set-Up-a-Darkroom-Photo-Enlarger-Machine) for more information on how to set up the darkroom machine. Start by laying all the trays out in a row. Fill the first with developer, the second with stop bath, the third with fixer, and the last should have running water. A set of tongs should be next to each solution tray and should not be mixed up.

Once you have exposed your light sensitive photo paper, place it in the developer tray with the tongs for recommended 1 minute minimum. Ensure to fully cover the photograph for this duration, otherwise it will not develop. This is done by gently agitating the tray to move the solution and possibly using the tongs to assist.

Once the minute has passed, use the same tongs to pick up the photo and place it in the stop bath tray. These tongs should not touch this solution. Leave the photo for recommended 10 seconds minimum. This halts the development process.

Once the time has passed, use the tongs by this tray to pick up the photo and place it in the fixer tray.  These tongs should not touch this solution. Leave the photo for the recommended 30 seconds minimum. This step sets the image and removes the light sensitivity of the paper.

Once the time has passed, use the tongs by this tray to pick up the photo and place it in the final rinse tray. These tongs should not touch this solution. Leave the photo in the running water for at least 5 minutes. The water needs to be running to help prevent the chemicals from building up in the tray and to help wash away these chemicals. Use the last pair of tongs to pick up the picture. Hang the picture up with pegs on a line to dry. This should take a few hours.

> ### Notes :
> - Always use separate tongs for each tray.
> - Label the chemicals and trays clearly.
> - The chemicals can damaged clothing, so either wear an apron, or clothes that you donâ€™t mind getting ruined.
