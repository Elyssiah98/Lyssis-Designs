In this experiment, I had the chance to work with Overhead Projector Paper (OHP) and create photographic images using it. I chose Ho-Oh because it’s a very colourful Pokémon, and I thought it would make for strong line-art. I was curious to see how a bright, colourful subject would translate into black and white.

## Tools & Materials :
### For Exposure :
-	Darkroom photo enlarger
-	Easel
-	Light-sensitive photographic paper
-	Block-out room/ block-out material/ block-out curtains
-	Safelight
-	Notebook (for recording settings)
-	Writing implement
-	Overhead projector paper (OHP Paper)
-	Markers / sharpies
### For Development :
-	4 trays
-	4 tongs
-	Developer solution (Ilford Multigrade Developer)
-	Stop bath solution (Ilford Ilfostop)
-	Fixer solution (Ilford Hypam Fixer)
-	Running water
-	A clock or timer
-	Pegs
-	Line to hold pegs

## Process :

I began by testing which materials worked best on OHP paper. I already had a variety of markers and drawing tools, so I experimented with those to see how they interacted with the transparency. I also found that some markers (such as highlighters), would not dry or show very well.

I found that sharpies gave the best results, so I used them to create a line drawing of the Pokémon Ho-Oh on the OHP paper.

Once in the studio, I [Set Up a Darkroom Exposure Machine](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Set-Up-a-Darkroom-Photo-Enlarger-Machine) and [Created a Test Exposure Strip](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Make-a-Test-Exposure-Strip). I incorporated the drawing into the test strip, making it a bit more creative, while still functional.

After that, I printed the design on a larger sheet of photographic paper. The result was clear and bold, though looking back, I wish I had exposed it longer to enhance the black and white contrast.

Encouraged by this, I decided to explore how coloured sharpies would affect the outcome. I coloured in the reverse side of the OHP paper, to where the line drawing had been done. It wasn’t the tidiest colouring, but I was hopeful it would translate interestingly.

This time, I set a longer exposure and then [Developed the Print](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/Developing-Photos). I wasn’t entirely happy with the result, but the process was a valuable lesson. If I were to repeat this experiment, I would consider trying transparent paints or other materials to test how colour shows up under black and white exposure.
