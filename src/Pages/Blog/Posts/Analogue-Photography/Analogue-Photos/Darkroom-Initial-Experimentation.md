After completing a test exposure strip, I began to explore how the transparency of different objects and varying exposure times would affect the final photograph. This experimentation gave me a foundational understanding for future darkroom explorations.

## Tools & Materials :
### For Exposure :
- Darkroom photo enlarger
- Easel
- Light-sensitive photographic paper
- Block-out room / block-out materials / block-out curtains
- Safelight
- Notebook (for recording settings)
- Writing implement
- Lace
- A dried branch
- A transparent fabric leaf

### For Development :
- 4 trays
- 4 tongs
- Developer solution (Ilford Multigrade Developer)
- Stop bath solution (Ilford Ilfostop)
- Fixer solution (Ilford Hypam Fixer)
- Running water
- A clock or timer
- Pegs
- Line to hold pegs

## Process :

After completing the initial test exposure strip, (see [How to Set Up a Darkroom Photo Enlarger Machine](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Set-Up-a-Darkroom-Photo-Enlarger-Machine) & [How to Make a Test Exposure](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Make-a-Test-Exposure)), I wanted to see how the transparency of different objects would influence the final result. I set up the photo enlarger and placed a dried branch, a transparent fabric leaf and a piece of lace on top of the light-sensitive paper.

I exposed the setup for 30 seconds, then developed the photograph and hung it to dry. See [Developing Photos](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/Developing-Photos).

Encouraged by the outcome, I wanted to explore how exposure time affected the image. I arranged four pieces of lace, one in each corner of the photographic paper. At 5-second intervals, I removed one lace piece at a time, developing the photo afterward.

I repeated the experiment, this time removing the lace at 3-second intervals. The result was much clearer, and I was pleased to see how distinctly the exposure times impacted the final image.
