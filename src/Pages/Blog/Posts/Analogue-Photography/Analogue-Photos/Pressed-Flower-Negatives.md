In this project, I explored how physical negatives can be used creatively to form unique photographic designs. I have many [Pressed Flowers](#blog/Other/Preparing-&-Pressing-Flowers).md from about 15 years ago, and their semi-transparency made them excellent options for darkroom experimentation.

I started by placing my pressed lily petals inside a Ziplock bag and laying them into the film carrier. I then [Created a Test Exposure Strip](#/blog/Analogue-Photography/Analogue-Photo-Techniques/How-to-Make-a-Test-Exposure-Strip) with lilies in place as a negative. The first test came out very bright and I was introduced to using contrast filters to correct this.

I did another test exposure, this time with the contrast filters applied, and the results were much better. However, I felt that at this close-up scale, the lilies weren’t the most visually engaging negative, so I moved onto something new.

Next, I tested a pressed miniature flower. I wasn’t sure if it was transparent enough to work effectively as a negative., but I placed it under the enlarger and created a new test exposure strip. The result was stunning. The contrast brought out the texture beautifully and the details of the flower appeared clear and delicately. This gave me confidence to move forwards with a proper print.

The first print using the pressed flower was done on a smaller sheet of photographic paper. While technically not a test strip, this was a standalone image made to gauge how the full composition would develop. It came out even better than I expected, with great clarity and strong contrast.

This second photo used a full-sized sheet of paper, and again the outcome was stunning. The clarity was excellent, and I loved that one of the smaller flowers was captured near the edges of the frame. The only downside was that the full large flower didn’t quite fit in the frame. As it was the end of class, I did not have time to redo it.

Although I couldn’t do another photo, I decided to digitally join the two photos. The first photo had captured the missing petal edge, so I used Affinity Photo 2 on my iPad to join them together. I thought it was a smart way to salvage what was almost a perfect image.

> This was my favourite piece from my time in the darkroom studio. I would love the opportunity to explore more floral negatives in the future.
