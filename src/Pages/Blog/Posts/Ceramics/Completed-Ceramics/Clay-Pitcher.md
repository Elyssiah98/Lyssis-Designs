This piece began as a simple ceramic pitcher made using slab construction techniques. I had originally followed the instructions to create a cylindrical form but later added decorative features and carved surface textures to turn it into a unique piece. What started as a functional form ended up being a more imaginative ceramic creation.

## Tools & Materials :
- White clay
- Sponge
- Scoring tool
- Coloured slips (light yellow, light brown, black and green)
- Sgraffito tool
- Transparent glaze
- Paintbrushes

## Process :

I began this piece by building a pitcher using the slap cylinder technique, which I’ve detailed in [Making a Clay Pitcher](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Making-a-Clay-Pitcher). Once the form was complete and upright, I added eyes to the front of the it. To ensure that they stayed attached throughout the drying and firing, I scored both the eyes and the surface, and then just used a small amount of slip to join them securely.

The pitcher was left to dry for a week before decorating. During that time, I realised I'd missed the teacher’s notes that we were making bird pitchers, but by then it had hardened too much to try reshaping. Instead of forcing it, I choose to take it in my own direction.

I decided to decorate it with tree inspired textures, using the [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) technique to carve woodgrain lines into the surface. I first painted the pitcher in a decorative light-yellow [Slip](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) to create a soft background colour.

Once dry enough to carve, I used a fine sgraffito tool to etch detailed lines across the surface to resemble woodgrain, adding knots and curves for realism. Inside some of the lines, I painted light brown slip to enhance the layered wood texture.

To make the carved knots stand out even more, I added touches of black slip and then painted the eyes a green to match the nature theme. I continued the decoration with small green leaves across the surface and painted the inside of the top third of the pitcher in a matching green tone.

As a final detail, I signed the base by painting it green and etching my name into it with sgraffito.

The finished piece was then glazed and fired by my teacher, using a [Transparent Glaze](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Glazing-Clay) to seal and protect the surface. The glaze also brought out the vibrancy of the colours and added a glossy finish to the woodgrain textures.
