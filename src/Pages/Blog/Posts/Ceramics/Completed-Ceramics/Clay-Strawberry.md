This project began as an exploration of hollow clay forms using [Pinch Pots](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Making-a-Hollow-Sphere-with-Pinch-Pots). Although I initially intended to create a spherical shape, the process didn't go exactly as planned. Instead, it turned into something even better. By adapting my approach and embracing the unexpected challenges, I was able to transform the piece into a hand built strawberry. I used both [Decorative Slip Painting](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) and [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) to add surface detail.

## Tools & Materials :
- White clay
- Small wooden tool (for blending and scoring)
- Slip (red, orange, yellow, and green)
- Small brushes
- Sponge
- Sgraffito carving tool
- Water
- Container for holding water
- Cloth or towel
- Glaze (transparent)

## Process :

At first, I planned to make a smooth, hollow sphere by joining two pinch pots together. However, I made the walls too thin, and I couldn't really achieve a neat spherical shape. My teacher joked that it could become an “old pear,” but that wasn't really the direction I wanted. Instead, I took the opportunity to reshape the form into a strawberry, pinching and adjusting it slightly; before adding a hole in the back, which would help with airflow during firing.

The piece was left to firm up over a week, reaching a leather-hard stage. Once ready, I used a sponge to gently smooth the surface and slowly shape it further to better resemble a strawberry; rounder at the top with a taper at the tip. I took my time, refining the shape bit by bit, while ensuring the surface was clean and even.

When it came time to decorate, I painted the surface using layers of [Coloured Slip](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay). This part requires a lot of patience, as I needed to wait between each coat to avoid smudging or lifting the previous layer. I began at the base with green, carefully blending it into yellow, then orange, and then finally a red over the body of the strawberry. Achieving a smooth gradient was tricky, but I took it slow and let the slip dry in stages to avoid muddy colours.

Once the slip was fully dry, I used [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) techniques to carve out small seeds across the surface. Each cut revealed the white clay underneath, creating a lovely contrast with the red slip enhancing the strawberry texture.

Finally, the piece was glazed and fired by my teacher, using a [Transparent Glaze](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Glazing-Clay) to bring out the vibrancy of the colours and to protect the surface. The finished strawberry turned out better than I imagined: bright, detailed, full of character, subtle texturing and a glossy finish. All combined, this truly made the strawberry come to life.
