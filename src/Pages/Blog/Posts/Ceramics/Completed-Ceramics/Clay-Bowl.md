This ceramic bowl was my first experience with combining form and surface decoration in ceramics. After learning the coil-building technique, I was challenged to create a bowl with Māori inspired designs, using multiple methods of decoration. This project taught me how to work with decorative slips, sgraffito, and layers of detail (even when parts of the surface were harder to access).

## Tools & Materials :
- White clay
- Sponge
- Water
- Container to hold water
- Scoring tool
- Knife
- Coloured slips (various colours)
- Sgraffito tool
- Transparent glaze

## Process :

This piece started out as a coil-built bowl, made by layering flattened coils of clay on top of each other to gradually build up height and shape. You can read about the full construction process in [Coil Building a Clay Bowl](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Coil-Building-a-Clay-Bowl).

Once the bowl had set slightly, I cut away the uneven edge of the base using a knife to clean up the shape. I then gently smoothed the entire surface with a damp sponge, softening the texture and preparing it for decoration.

We were given the task of creating a design inspired by Māori patterns or symbolism. I came up with a few designs and you can see a selection of them here.

I initially attempted to add details using [Decorative Slip](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) and [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) inside the bowl, but due to the depth and the curve, it was hard to reach those areas cleanly.

Instead, I focused on the outer surface of the bowl. I first applied a blue slip as a base layer, then began carving a large flower shape using sgraffito. I also started trying to carve in some leaves, but they proved more difficult to shape consistently.

To fix this, I decided to paint a few coats of green slip over the blue in leaf-like shapes, then carved my designs into that. This worked much better, the green on top of the blue created a nice, layered colour effect where the sgraffito lines revealed the under colour. I added small pink dots as blossoms, which also needed several layers to become vibrant.

As my confidence grew, I added leaf motifs inside the bowl, and this time I was able to manage the curved surface more effectively. Near the base of the bowl, I painted a swirly, swooping shape and then used sgraffito to carve my name into it as a final touch.

The bowl was left to completely dry over a week, and then we applied a [Transparent Glaze](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Glazing-Clay) to protect the surface and bring out the depth of the slip colours.

The final result was a textured, multilayered ceramic piece that was nicely decorated with various techniques. It was a great early challenge in planning a surface design that interacts with the shape of the clay object.
