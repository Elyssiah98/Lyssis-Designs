This post covers how I applied transparent glaze to my bisque-fired ceramic pieces. Transparent glaze is often used to enhance surface decoration, such as [Coloured Slip](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) or [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito), while adding a smooth, glossy finish. This process required careful handling to avoid damaging the glaze surface and ensuring an even coat across the piece.

## Tools & Materials :
- Bisque-fired ceramic pieces
- Transparent glaze
- Glaze tongs
- Container for dipping
- Small brush
- Damp sponge
- Dry cloth or textured mat (for base cleaning)
- Apron / gloves

## Process :
Before glazing, I checked my bisque-fired piece for dust or residue and gave it a light wipe with a damp sponge, as needed. Any dirt can cause imperfections in the final finish. I made sure not to soak the piece too much, as too much moisture can prevent the glaze from adhering properly.

I used glaze tongs to gently grip and dip my piece into the transparent glaze bucket. The glaze was stirred beforehand to ensure an even consistency. I held it in the glaze just long enough to get full coverage, then lifted it out carefully.
After dipping, I placed the piece on a clean surface and waited about 20 minutes for the glaze to stop dripping. Once it was touch dry, I gently rubbed the base of the piece on a cloth to remove any glaze from the bottom. This is important, as glaze left on the base can melt in the kiln and cause the piece to stick to the shelf, which damages the kiln.

Unfortunately, I accidentally gripped my piece too tightly while removing the glaze from the bottom of the bowl. I was shown how to gently paint extra glaze onto those bare areas using a brush. This touch up helped even out the surface and avoid bare patches in the final firing.

Once the glaze was fully dry, the piece was ready to be loaded into the kiln for its final glaze firing. The transparent finish came out glossy and helped enhance the surface decoration beneath, especially with the [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) and [Decorative Slip](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) work.

> ### Notes:
> I only glazed the [Bowl](#/blog/Ceramics/Completed-Ceramics/Clay-Bowl) myself. The [Strawberry](#/blog/Ceramics/Completed-Ceramics/Clay-Strawberry) and [Pitcher](#/blog/Ceramics/Completed-Ceramics/Clay-Pitcher) were completed by the teacher due to time constraints.
