This clay bowl introduced me to the coil building method, which is one of the oldest hand-building techniques in ceramics. I learnt about layering clay coils, how to carefully construct them, and blending the seams for height and strength. The bowl I made during this process would later be decorated with two different surface techniques, which I have linked at the end of this post/

## Tools & Materials :
- White clay
- Small wooden tool (for scoring and joining clay)
- Wooden circular bat (baseboard to build on)

## Process :

To begin, I made a small round slab for the base by starting with a ball of clay and gently patting it between my hands. Once the clay was shaped into a fairly flat disk, I used the tips of my fingers to feel for any thick spots and pressed the clay thinner until the slab was an even thickness throughout. I then placed this slab directly onto the circular wooden base to begin building the bowl.

Using the small wooden tool, I scored the outer edge of the clay base where the first coil would be attached. This helps the new clay to be added to grip securely, preventing cracks or separation as the bowl dries.

I created a ball of clay and added a small amount of water to the bench to stop the clay from drying out while I worked. I began shaping the clay into a coil by gently rolling it back and forth on the bench using the palm of my hands. I started from the center and gradually worked outwards to keep the thickness consistent along the length of the coil. Once the coil was the correct length and thickness, I gently flattened it, then cut one end at an angle in preparation for attaching it to the base.

I wrapped the coil around the edge of the base, and when I reached the other side, I cut the other end at the same angle to match and scored it lightly. This makes it easier to join the two ends smoothly and helps maintain the form. After attaching the coil, I blended the seam by smoothing the clay over the join. I used my fingers and a small wooden tool to ensure the pieces became one solid form.

For the second layer, I made another coil and scored the top inner edge of the first coil before attaching it to the inside of the previous one. I also made sure that the new coil’s join didn’t sit directly on top of the one below to prevent weak point. Once attached, I again blended the seam, gently pressing and smoothing the inside and outer edges together so that no lines remained. This layering technique helps with stability and reduces the risk of cracking later.

I repeated this process one final time to add a third coil. After smoothing and blending the joins, I gently pulled the edges outward to start forming the final bowl shape.

Once the structure was complete, I left the bowl to set before moving on to the surface decoration. See [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) & [Slip Decorating Clay](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) for decoration techniques of the clay.
