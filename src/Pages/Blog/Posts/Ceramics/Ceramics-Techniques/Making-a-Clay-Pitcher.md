This project taught me how to construct a clay pitcher from a flat slab, using hand building techniques and a few simple tools. I learnt how to form a cylinder, create a sealed base, and shape a pouring spout. It was a challenge to keep the joins neat and the form consistent, but I gained a much better understanding of clay construction and function through the process.

## Tools & Materials :
- White clay
- Slab roller or Two guide sticks and a rolling pin
- Paper stencil (rectangle)
- Craft knife (for cutting the clay)
- Sponge
- Water
- Container to hold water
- Tape
- Wooden or plastic roller (for shaping and support)
- Small rounded cylinder or wooden tool (for pressing the base)

## Process :
I started by rolling out a flat slab of white clay, using guide sticks to ensure even thickness across the entire surface. Once it was ready, I used a paper stencil to cut out a clean rectangle from the slab.

To help with joining, I flattened one edge of the clay, then scored both the flattened edge and the opposite edge using a pointed tool. This scoring helps the clay grip and bind more securely. I also applied a little slip between the edges before joining.

I then wrapped the clay slab around a wooden roller, using the roller itself to help create the cylindrical shape. Once the score edges met, I pressed them together firmly with the roller and used a damp sponge and fingers to smooth the seam, to ensure it blended in with the surface and kept the wall even.

Next, I turned the cylinder upright and cut four evenly spaced slots into the base, like flaps on a cardboard box. These flaps were folded inward, overlapping one another to begin forming the base of the pitcher.

To reinforce the join and fully closed the bottom, I flipped the pitcher over and added a small piece of extra clay inside, pressing it down gently with a rounded tool. This helped to compress the base and ensure the form was sealed and stable.

To finish, I cut the top of the pitcher to be even, then pinched and shaped one side of the rim to form a simple pouring spout. This spout was 90Â° from the main seam for strength. I carefully pulled the clay outward and upward, smoothing the edges slightly for a cleaner finish. I also made two small divits on the sides for easier gripping
