This project introduced me to the technique of forming a hollow shape by joining two pinch pots together. It was a great way to practice control, even wall thickness, and blending joins. Although it's a simple form, it lays a solid foundation for clay works in future.
## Tools & Materials :
- White clay
- Wooden scraper tool
- Slip
- Sponge
- Container
- Water

## Process :

I started with two small balls of clay and formed them into pinch pots. To do this, I pressed my thumb into the centre of the ball and carefully squeezed around the sides, while rotating the clay. I was aiming for an even wall thickness, but accidentally made them a little too thin, which made them a bit more delicate to work with.

I was instructed to make the two pinch pots slightly different sizes. This made it easier to join them, as one part could nest slightly inside the other. I scored the rim of the smaller pot on the outside, and the rim of the larger pot on the inside. I then applied slip to both scored areas, before pressing them gently together.

Once the pots were joined, I pinched around the seam to fuse the clay and then smoothed over the outside using a wooden tool. This helped blend the seam into the surface and refine the shape. I had to work carefully because of the thinner walls, but I was still able to get a rounded finish. As I didn't have a fully spherical shape, I adjusted it into a strawberry-like shape. See [Clay Strawberry](#/blog/Ceramics/Completed-Ceramics/Clay-Strawberry) for more information.

To prevent cracking during drying or firing process, I made a small air hole using a wooden tool. It was about 5mm wide; wide enough to safely let air escape from the hollow interior.

After a final smooth over with a damp sponge the sphere, or in this case the strawberry, is ready to dry.


I proceeded to decorate the strawberry. See [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito) & [Slip Decorating Clay](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay) for decoration techniques of the clay.
