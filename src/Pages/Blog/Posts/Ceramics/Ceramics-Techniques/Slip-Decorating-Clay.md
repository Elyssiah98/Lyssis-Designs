This post covers the process of decorating clay with slip, a smooth, liquid clay mixture applied to leather-hard ceramics. I used this technique on several pieces to explore contrast, texture, and surface design before firing. It helped me learn how to apply slip cleanly and control design elements using different methods, including paper stencils and basic carving.

## Tools & Materials :
- Leather -hard clay piece (e.g. bowl, pitcher, etc.)
- Prepared slip (various coloured)
- Paintbrushes
- Paper stencils
- Sgraffito tools
- Sponge
- Small containers for slip
- Water
- Container for water

## Process :
I started by gently smoothing the leather hard clay surface with a damp sponge. This helped even out any small imperfections and removed dust that might interfere with the slip application. The clay needs to be damp enough for the slip to adhere properly, but not so wet that the surface becomes sticky or soft.
Using a soft paintbrush, I applied an even coat of slip to the surface. I made sure the layer was smooth and consistent, letting it settle slightly before continuing. On some pieces I used a single coat; others needed two coats for a more opaque finish. Each coat allowed to set slightly in between the painting of the layers.

For some of the designs, I cut paper stencils in simple shapes and pressed them on to the damp clay surface before applying slip over the top. Once the slip was applied, I carefully peeled the stencils away to reveal clean patterns where the clay body was left exposed. This was a useful method for adding bold contrast and clean edges to a design.

In some areas, I used [Sgraffito](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Sgraffito). This is a technique where I gently scratched back into the slip to reveal the clay underneath. This added texture and linework over the blocked-in shapes created by the stencils and the brush-painted designs.

Once the design was finished, I allowed the decorated piece to dry completely before firing. Slip becomes part of the surface during firing and can be further enhanced with [Glaze](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Glazing-Clay).
