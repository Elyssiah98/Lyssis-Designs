This post explains how I used the sgraffito technique to decorate leather-hard clay pieces. Sgraffito involve scratching through a layer of coloured slip to reveal the clay underneath, allowing for detailed designs, linework and contrast. It's a satisfying method for combining drawing with ceramics. I used this technique to add visually interesting details to my ceramic pieces.

## Tools & Materials :
- Leather-hard clay piece
- Prepared slip (various colours)
- Sgraffito tools (skewer, carving tool, etc.)
- Soft paintbrush
- Damp sponge
- Small containers for slip
- Water
- Container for water

## Process :
I began by making sure my clay surface was smooth and evenly damp. It could not be too wet, or the slip wouldn't adhere properly. I used a damp sponge to gently even out the surface and remove any dust before applying the slip.

Using a paintbrush, I coated the leather-hard clay with [Coloured Slip](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Slip-Decorating-Clay). I chose colours that would contrast well with the base clay body so that the carved designs would stand out clearly. In most cases, I applied one to two thin coats, depending on the desired coverage. I allowed the slip to settle and become touch-dry before carving.

I used the sgraffito tools to carefully scratch away parts of the slip and reveal the clay underneath. I experimented with line weights, patterns, and textures to create visual contrast. Some of my pieces were more illustrative, while others focused on repeated shapes and simple linework.

The key was to carve slowly and confidently. Thin, shallow lines gave clean detail, while deeper marks exposed more of the clay underneath.

After the design was completed, I left the piece to dry fully before it was bisque fired. After firing, the carved patterns remained clean and were further enhanced with a [Transparent Glaze](#/blog/Ceramics/Ceramics-Techniques/Glazing-Clay).
